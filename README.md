# PianoTiles
This game is a customized version of the piano tiles game using only 4 tiles.
We have connected push buttons to basys 3 for input and a speaker for output.
This game is a one-player game where the player will press the button corresponding to the indicated tile on the screen in order to play the tune. If pressed correctly the tile will turn green for a few seconds and the score will be incremented by 1, otherwise it will turn red and 1 point from the score will be deducted. Our control block will then move to the next tile in the sequence.
The game will end when the song sequence has been completed.
